    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        A Gold Rush cocktail is a riff on a whiskey sour using honey syrup instead of<br>
        simple syrup. The honey syrup is commonly made with a 1:1 ratio of honey to<br>
        water, but I find that a 2:1 ratio helps to better balance out the lemon juice and<br>
        bourbon. This makes enough syrup for 4 cocktails. Serve over a large ice sphere.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Honey Syrup:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cocktail:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups ice</li>
        <li>2 fluid ounces bourbon</li>
        <li>3/4 fluid ounce honey syrup</li>
        <li>3/4 fluid ounce fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>lemon twist, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a small saucepan, combine honey and water over medium heat. Bring to a<br>
            simmer, stirring, until honey is dissolved. Remove from heat and cool<br>
            completely. To account for evaporation, add a splash of water to bring the total<br>
            volume of syrup up to 3 fluid ounces, if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add 1 cup of ice to a cocktail shaker. Add bourbon, honey syrup and lemon juice.<br>
            Cover and shake until chilled, 15 to 20 seconds. Fill a rocks glass with remaining<br>
            ice cubes or 1 large ice sphere and strain cocktail over the ice. Garnish with<br>
            lemon twist.
